**Galpro**

Galpro is a novel Python machine learning code based on the Random Forest algorithm for estimating multivariate 
posterior probability distributions of redshift and physical properties (e.g. stellar mass, star formation rate,
metallicity) of galaxies. Documentation for the package is available at `galpro.readthedocs.io <https://galpro.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Galpro is hosted on PyPI and can be installed using::

    pip install galpro
