**Galpro**

Galpro is a novel Python machine learning code based on the Random Forest algorithm for estimating multivariate 
posterior probability distributions of galaxy properties (e.g. redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate,
metallicity). Documentation for the package is available at `galpro.readthedocs.io <https://galpro.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Galpro is in the final stages of development and will be hosted on PyPI in the near future::

    pip install galpro
